Fifth Lab Assignment

For following problems, solutions need to be implemented through threads using semaphores, processes (coded as separate programs) using semaphores implemented in shared memory.

A) Using semaphores, implement solution to producer-consumer problem. It is given that there 

(1) is one producer and one consumer

(2) multiple producers and one consumer

(3) one producer and multiple consumers 

(4) multiple producers and multiple consumers

 

(B) Using semaphores, implement solution to readers-writers problem. You need to implement all three solutions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem)
